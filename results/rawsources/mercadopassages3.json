Partly\n from its peculiar colour, partly from a superstition which represented\n it as feeling the influence of the deity whom it adorned, and growing\n and lessening in lustre with the waxing and waning of the moon, it\n first gained the name by which it continues to be known in India to\n this day--the name of THE MOONSTONE. A similar superstition was once\n prevalent, as I have heard, in ancient Greece and Rome; not applying,\n however (as in India), to a diamond devoted to the service of a god, but\n to a semi-transparent stone of the inferior order of gems, supposed to\n be affected by the lunar influences--the moon, in this latter case also,\n giving the name by which the stone is still known to collectors in our\n own time.\n \n The adventures of the Yellow Diamond begin with the eleventh century of\n the Christian era.\n \n At that date, the Mohammedan conqueror, Mahmoud of Ghizni, crossed\n India; seized on the holy city of Somnauth; and stripped of its\n treasures the famous temple, which had stood for centuries--the shrine\n of Hindoo pilgrimage, and the wonder of the Eastern world.\n \n Of all the deities worshipped in the temple, the moon-god alone escaped\n the rapacity of the conquering Mohammedans. Preserved by three Brahmins,\n the inviolate deity, bearing the Yellow Diamond in its forehead, was\n removed by night, and was transported to the second of the sacred cities\n of India--the city of Benares.\n", "subjectivetime": 0, "idx": 1, "ellipsisphrase": "", "subjectivephrase": "", "complete": true, "narratedtime": 241920.0, "ellipsistime": 0}, {"text": "\n Not a soul was told the girl's story, excepting Miss Rachel and me.
